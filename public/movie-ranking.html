<h1>Kristian Braun's Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
    <h2>These are my favorite movies that I've watched</h2>
<hr/>
        <h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
        <p>This has to be the number one spot. Everything about the movie is immediately gripping, 
            even to people who have no paraticular interest in superhero films. 
            This movie is in a class of its own in terms of cinematography, suspense, 
            action and stunt scenes, character performances, character themes, dialogue; its all here. 
            The Dark Knight is a piece of movie history that I encourage everyone to see.</p>
        
        <h3>Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)</h3>
        <p>Mad Max: Fury Road is a high octane, post apocalyptic movie with heavy emphasis on insane practical stunts and effects.
            The entire movie was painstakingly storyboarded for every scene, and every piece of the setting is highly detailed and immersive.
            Of course, the action is in a class of its own, mostly taking place while driving at top speeds in jury rigged murder-mobiles all while in the scorching desert.
            Highly recommend for intense, jaw-dropping action scenes in a unique setting.</p>

        <h3>Nobody(2021)</h3>
        <p>While not the insane, serious movies listed above, Nobody is an incredibly fun and charming action movie about a man who breaks
        out of his mundane, overbearing life. It's so cool to see a main character who everyone, and even himself sees as a weakling actually
        be the best and most capable out of all of them. Very fun and underrated romp, highly recommend.
