<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. My name is Kristian Braun. I'm a student currently studying at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science. 
  This is my web portfolio which you can find my software and web development projects.
  I'm set to graduate in 2024 and am dedicated to improving my suite of technical skills. 
  This website was actually part of an assignment for a webdev course I'm currently enrolled in! 
  Feel free to reach out if you have any questions in the
